 * There are two players, first write a secret 4 digit code using different digits, second player has to guess it
 * grades answer using bulls and cows as a notation
 * if digits is correct and in position -> bull
 * it digits is correct but position is wrong -> cow
 * first player reveal how many bulls and cows there are
 *

 * features
 * 1. print game log
 *   - print player1 turn [x]
 *   - print player2 turn [x]
 * 2. games grade
 *   - pre code the secret code [x]
 *   - user enter input [x]
 *   - output how many is bulls and cow and output the secret code [x]
 * 3. generate the secret code [x]
 *   - secret code length is not greater than 10 [x]
    - digits must be unique [x]
    - must contain from 1-9 [x]
    - first digit cannot be 0 [x]
  4. Combine the game [x]
    - player need input the length of the secret code [x]
    - games ended until number of bulls is equal to the number of digits in the code [x]
    - congratulates winner [x]

 5. add new level
    - add support for more than 10 symbols including letters too

    - secret code length is not greater than the number of possible symbols [x]

 6. Error handling
    - handle incorrect input
        - input length and number of possible symbols must be an integer [x]
        - handle number of max code which is 36 [x]
        - number of possible symbols must be greater or equals to len of code [x]
